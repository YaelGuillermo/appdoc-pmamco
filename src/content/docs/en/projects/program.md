# What is a Program?

A **Program** is an organized initiative that brings together books, documents, resources, and team members under a **common, specific objective**. It can be either an editorial department project or a structured course with defined start, development, and end phases.

Programs help maintain focused, measurable work aligned with specific goals. Whether you're coordinating a book series, an academic course, or a thematic content collection, the program is the structure that contains everything.
