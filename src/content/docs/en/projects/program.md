# What is a Program?

A **Program** is an organized initiative that brings together books, documents, resources, and team members under a **common, specific objective**. It can be either an editorial department project or a structured course with defined start, development, and end phases.

Programs help maintain focused, measurable work aligned with specific goals. Whether you're coordinating a book series, an academic course, or a thematic content collection, the program is the structure that contains everything.

## üìè Important limits and rules

- üîí **Maximum 5 active programs per person**  
  You can only have **5 active programs** at a time as owner. If you need to create a new one, you'll have to archive a previous one.

- üìÖ **Dates must make sense**  
  The **start date** must be before or equal to the **end date**. You can't create a program that ends before it starts.

- üîÑ **Progress is calculated automatically**  
  The system monitors the progress of books and documents within the program. You can view it in the general report.

## üí° Tips for creating a good program

- Use a **clear and specific title**, avoid generic names like "Project 1".
- Take advantage of the **description** to explain why this program exists and what it aims to achieve.
- Choose an **icon** related to the topic (e.g., a globe for international subjects).
- Define a **realistic period** according to workload: monthly for intensive projects, semester for long courses.
- Always check dates: a well-planned program facilitates teamwork.

## üìö What's next after creating a program?

Once created, you can:

- Add **books** and **documents** to the program
- Add **base products** and **peripherals** to the program
- Invite **team members** to collaborate
- Track **overall progress** from the dashboard
